All Pull Requests must follow the Pull Request Template, with a title formatted like such `[Project Name]: <Descriptive Title>`

1. <h4>What is the project focus/overall goal?</h4> 
To get a better idea about the distribution of landlords not enrolled in different affordable housing programs. Important features to be considered: number of units, geographic location, and the demographic profile of the census block group. We will also look into the percentage of housing stock that is owned by the owner occupied and the small landlords, and at % affordable.
2. <h4>What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?
</h4> The two main data sources are the current affordable housing listings database, and the 
current owner occupied units database.  The main request will rely on these.  Further analysis will benefit from Census or demographic data.  

3. <h4>What are potential limitations of the project?
</h4>We are hoping that we can find a cleaner way to join the two primary databases.  If not,  the join will be on address and likely involve lower integrity.  Linking up demographic data will likely have similar challenges.  We want to look at generation of citizenship, and some other demographics that may require additional data sources.  

4. <h4>Why is this project important or Why did you choose this project?
</h4>We have chosen this assignment since many students opt to live in Boston after college for work. Since housing discrimination can have large implicit biases and have consequences for years, we wish to understand how Boston is meeting affordable housing for different demographics. 
5. <h4>What is your team’s next steps? (include action items/tasks)
</h4>Our next steps are to wait for Tom to get back to us about whether or not he can join the 2 datasets we have been provided. From here either we can move forward with the joined data or we will have to join the data ourselves. Following this we will have to clean the data. From then on we can begin processing the data. Some demographics we will explore are income, race, gender, neighborhood. Also we wish to see general affordability information about Boston’s neighborhoods.
