## Status Report

As of this deliverable no notable changes have been made to the dataset. However, we utilized the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) to try and mitigate the data limitations described in [`deliverable-1.md`](./deliverable-1.md).
